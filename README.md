I am Eddy. Edward Marshall for long. I am a software engineer with a passion for creating accessible education with diverse teams for diverse populations. Feel free to take a look at my [portfolio](https://eddymarshall.github.io/portfolio/) to see a more aesthetically pleasing representation of the information below. 

I'm currently most likely working on a Nashville hot chicken sandwich with some spicy aioli or a sushi deluxe dinner. Between bites and aggressive moist towelette usages I am working on a few apps that will help my music students with different techniques. Currently, I have a [voice leading app](https://eddymarshall.github.io/Voice_Leading_Visualizer/) that is live and still being built out. Soon it will include sheet music visualizations so that it can be used by non guitarists, thus meeting my personal expectation of being as accessible as possible. I am also developing a sight reading app that will help music students build on a very underpracticed and highly sought after skill. 

In other news I am building out websites for artists in the New York City area. I use react, HTML, and CSS and collaborate closely with the artist to ensure that their artistic vision is conveyed. 

I am comfortable working in: React | JavaScript | Redux | HTML | CSS | Ruby | Ruby on Rails | Mongoose | MongoDB | Node.js | Express.js | SQL | PostgreSQL | jQuery | Git | Heroku | AWS

Before becoming a programmer, I studied music education at Berklee College of music. I graduated magna cum laude in 2015 and moved to New York City to become a musician and a guitar teacher. As a teacher, I was always reflecting upon lessons past and considering how they could be improved upon. In 2020, seemingly small disconnects between students and teachers were thrown into sharp relief when all teaching was moved to a remote classroom and it was time to make a change to my teaching style. I threw everything I had at these students and observed what worked, but there was always at least one thing that I thought I could improve. I constantly found myself wishing there was "an app for that." Turned out, there could be, I just had to be the one to create it. Thus, a software engineer was born.
