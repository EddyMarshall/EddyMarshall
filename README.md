### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my domain.

I am Eddy. Edward Marshall for long. I am a software engineer with a passion for creating accessible education with diverse teams for diverse populations. 

I'm currently most likely working on a Nashville hot chicken sandwich with some spicy aioli or a sushi deluxe dinner. Between bites and moist towellette usages, I'm also building a handful of websites for artists in the New York City area.
